            <p class="first-para">
            The simple answer for Web Accessibility is that all internet content should be built in a way that allows everybody to physically and mentally use it. The simple reason for Web Accessibility is that the web content is vital and critical to maintaining people's everyday lives! In today's world, the internet is a fountain of life-sustaining information that everybody drinks from in order to survive.

            This blog post is my first article, of many to come, which will document the progress of who, what, where, why and when this huge unprecedented problem will be resolved ..... or not resolved! This blog series is my way of addressing a new and growing problem inside the old "information-digital-divide". This series is my humble attempt to become somewhat of an authority on an issue that sincerely humbles me.

            Let's first explain the basics of what it is and why it keeps being discussed. Web Accessibility increases everyone's ability to have access to important information and critical data needed to manage their day to day activities. Unfortunately, many people are not able to physically search and retrieve content because of the way the software programs have been built.

                Its a Brave New World out here folks! In a split second, anything can happen to any of us, at any time to disable or handicap your ability to access vital and critical web content.

            </p>
            <p class="first-para" style="text-align:left; margin-left:100px;">
                Lawsuit filings are rapidly increasing because much information and data on the web is actually life-sustaining and vital to the daily maintence of people's lives. Beyonce was <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/04/beyonce-parkwood-entertainment-sued-over-website-accessibility">recently sued over her website</a></span> because it alledgedly violated ADA regulations. It seems nowadays that information and data is so important, by so many people, that accessibility lawsuits are becoming more commonplace in the corporate world. In 2018, there were over 1000 lawsuits filed related to web accessibility, according to the <span><a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/2018s-flood-of-accessibility-lawsuits">BOIA.org</a></span>.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left; margin-left:100px;
            margin-bottom:30px;">
                Some of the industries being sued include clothing and apparel, telecommunications, restaurants, consumer goods, and e-commerce. Some blame the US Department of Justice for lack of clear guidelines on web access compliance. The US <span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/enforcing-ada">DOJ is responsible for compliance</a></span>. The DOJ is responsible for compliance of the Americans with Disabilities Act signed into law on July 26, 1990, by then President George HW Bush.

                3) A Profitable Business Case for Web Accessibility
            </p> 
            <p class="first-para" style="text-align:left; margin-left:100px;">
                A mind-boggling paradox for this entire issue of lack of sufficient web accessibility is the business case some are making that supports improving web accessibility. The narrative for that business case says it is estimated that 1 billion people with various disabilities and handicaps ironically represent over <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/">6 trillion dollars</a></span> in spending power. That narrative, if true, is a huge deal-breaker for any company, large or small, who is ignoring or sitting on the sidelines of this problem.
            </p>
            <p class="last-para" style="text-align:left; margin-left:100px;
            margin-bottom:30px;">
                This is a window of opportunity for some companies, corporations, government agencies, and global ngo's to eliminate this "lack of web access problem". In turn, the winners and problem solvers will acquire many life-long loyal customers who appreciate that you solved a "very good problem" by enabling them to release $6 trillion dollars of spending power.
